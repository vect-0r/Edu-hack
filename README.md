# Edu-hack
The purpose of this repository is to build a successful hack for Eduthon - IIIT Lucknow's pan-India Hackathon.
We have tried to build a one-to-one personal tutoring system where student can interact with tutor and get all his doubts solved.
Also, alongside this we have developed a notes-sharing web application.
